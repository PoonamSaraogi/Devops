AWS Route 53 Cheat Sheet
Overview
Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end-user requests to internet applications.

Key Features:

DNS Management: Manage DNS records and routing of internet traffic.
Traffic Management: Balance traffic loads, route users to closest resources.
Domain Registration: Register new domains directly.
Availability Monitoring: Check endpoint health and route traffic accordingly.
Global Service: Operates globally, not region-specific.
IPv6 Support: Fully supports IPv6 addresses.
DNS Resolution Flow


User Query: User's DNS resolver sends a query.
Root Server: Directs query to appropriate TLD (.com, .org, .in, etc.).
TLD Server: Points to the domain's authoritative nameserver
Nameserver: Provides the corresponding IP address.
User Machine: Receives the IP address and connects to the website.


Domain Levels
Generic Level Domains: .com, .org, .net
Geographic Level Domains: .in, .us, .uk


Integration with GoDaddy
Name Servers: Use unique nameservers from Route 53.
GoDaddy Setup: Update GoDaddy with AWS nameservers.
Hosted Zones: Create a hosted zone in AWS if the domain is from GoDaddy. If the domain is from AWS, the hosted zone is created automatically.
Hosted Zones
Limits: 500 hosted zones per account, 10,000 records per hosted zone (increased by request).
Types: Public (accessible globally) and Private (within a VPC).
Components:
Name Server (NS): Unique nameservers.
Start of Authority (SOA): Contains hosted zone information.
Note: Do not edit NS or SOA records.

Record Types
A Record: Maps domain name to IPv4 address.
AAAA Record: Maps domain name to IPv6 address.
CNAME: Maps alias to a domain name (for subdomains, not root domains).
NS Record: Specifies nameservers.
MX Record: Mail exchange record.
SOA Record: Provides authoritative information about the domain.



Routing Policies
Simple Routing: Default routing without additional configuration.
Failover Routing: Primary and backup resources for high availability.
Geolocation Routing: Directs traffic based on user location.
Multi-value Answer Routing: Supports up to 8 IP addresses for load balancing.
Latency-based Routing: Routes to the lowest latency endpoint.
Weighted Routing: Distributes traffic based on specified weights.
Geo Proximity Routing: Routes traffic based on geographic location, can shrink or expand regions.


Additional Considerations
Domain Transfer: Changing registrar from GoDaddy to AWS can take up to 48 hours.
Account Transfer: Hosted zones can't be transferred between accounts; only domains can.


Commands and Checks
NSLookup: Check NS records and get IP addresses.
WHOIS: Verify domain information and registrar details.
By using Route 53, you can efficiently manage your domain's DNS records, ensure high availability, and optimize traffic routing for your applications.
